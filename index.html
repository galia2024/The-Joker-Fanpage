    <h1>The Joker Fanpage</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the world of the Joker, Batman's most famous enemy! The Joker is known for his crazy clown look and wild behavior. He's really smart but uses his brains for all sorts of wild and scary plans. Sometimes he's super serious and scary, and other times he's just silly, but he always keeps Batman guessing.</p>
